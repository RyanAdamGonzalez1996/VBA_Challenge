Homework for Session 2: VBA
"In this homework assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. Depending on your comfort level with VBA, you may choose to challenge yourself with a few of the challenge tasks."

Created a code that will cycle through the Ticker column of each worksheet, and find the "Total Stock Volume" "Yearly Change" and "Percent Change" for each Ticker.
Also, the code creates two different charts; a "Summary Chart" and a "Greatest Summary Chart"
The "Summary Chart" finds the "Total Stock Volume" "Yearly Change" and "Percent Change" for each Ticker.
The "Greatest Sumamry Chart" displays which Ticker had the; "Greatest & Increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest Stock Value"

All of the cells in each chart have been modified to show accurate percentages and displays green for a positive "Yearly Change" and red for a negative "Yearly Change"
